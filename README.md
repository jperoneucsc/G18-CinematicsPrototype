# G18-CinematicPrototype
CMPM 120 Final Project - Group 18 Cinematic Prototype

This prototype displays an non-interactive cinematic, an interactive cinematic, and uses tween chains for code choreography.

The intro "logo" scene features our imaginary game company's logo. It fades in, hovers a bit, does a 360 degree rotation, a skateboard sound effect plays and then it fades out to black.

The "title" scene then plays. Here we have some simple looping animations to give off that "alive" appearance. The "play" and "credits" buttons scale down their respective text when pressed or hovered over.

The "logo" scene also features a tween chain. All animations are conducted through the tween chain-based variable "tween".
